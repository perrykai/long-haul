	<p class="intro">Hi! I'm Kaitlyn Daza.</p>
  <p>I'm a PhD candidate at Michigan State University studying microRNA regulation in pig skeletal muscle. I'm interested in pursuing a career in Science Communication when I finish my degree.</p>
  <p> I'm originally from Jenison, MI (near Grand Rapids), and I earned my bachelors degree in Animal Science from MSU in 2013. More recently, I got married to my amazing husband Gregory (in the pic above, to the left of the photo-bombing llama), and we're now living in Lansing, MI while I complete my PhD.</p> 
  <p> This blog will primarily consist of my ramblings on topics I find interesting, including genetics, bioinformatics, and agriculture. I also want to use this as a way of delving into the world of science communication, and get practice writing more creatively than my peer-reviewed publications allow. So, thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy my personal thoughts! </p>
